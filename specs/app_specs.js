// Shopping Basket Lab
// We need to find the price of a shopping basket. A shopping basket can have multiple items. It should be able to add and remove items.

// Discounts:

// 10% discount for all shopping baskets over Â£20
// If the customer has a valid discount card then they get and additional 5% off.
// Extension (hard!) Add the ability to have buy one get one free items.
